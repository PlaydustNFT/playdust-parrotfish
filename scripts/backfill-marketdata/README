Backfill marketdata 4 collection objects script does as it's name suggests. It cross checks all the execute sale transaction objects with the marketdata4collection objects. if a marketdata4collection object already exists, it skips the executesale transaction and writes nothing new for it.

For those without marketdata4collection related objects, it groups transactions by mint, lookup collection ids by mint, and creates a md4collection object for each transaction for each collection id!
