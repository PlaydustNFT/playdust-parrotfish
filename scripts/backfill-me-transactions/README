The backfill-me-transactions script reads a list of transaction signatures from a file and requests their payload from the Solana RPC endpoint url. It then feeds the payload into our MEv2
transaction parsing script, which converts the transaction into the Playdust normalized format.

The transactions are then written to the database. The database configuration options are the same as available in our other scripts. Options (self-explanatory):

- process.env.ACCESS_KEY
- process.env.SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- process.env.REGION
- process.env.DYNAMODB_ENDPOINT
- process.env.ENTITY_TABLE_NAME

### Input
the script will read from 1 file during it's execution
- process.env.INPUT_FILE_PATH

### Output
the script will write 2 files during it's execution
- process.env.ON_CHAIN_FAILURES_LOG
- process.env.CURRENT_SIGNATURES_LOG

Please see the top of the entrypoint.ts file for details about the configuration options for this script.

### How to run the script
npx ts-node entrypoint.ts
