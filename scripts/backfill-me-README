This README covers the process of backfilling ME transactions.

## High level overview
The process works as follows:

1) fetch the latest program tx signatures using the `backfill-program-tx-signatures` script
2) store the output of `backfill-program-tx-signatures` (latest signatures list) in the `reconcile-signatures/files` directory
3) fetch & parse transactions using the `backfill-me-transactions`, configured to write it's on-chain-failures / current signatures to `reconcile-signatures/files` directory
    a) Run this process iteratively until all transactions have been backfilled

Once the transactions have been backfilled, we can run the following subsequent processing:

1) Backfill the marketdata4collection objects using `backfill-marketdata`
2) Fetch current mint address list using `fetch-mint-addresses`
3) use the `mint_address_list.txt` as input to the `backfill-active-orders` script
4) Fetch the current collection id list using `fetch-collection-ids`
5) use the `collection_id_list.txt` as input to the `backfill-collection-price-attribute-data`

Once all of these steps are complete, the database should be backfilled with
- All MEv2 program transactions parsed
- All current listings (reflecting the most recent transaction signature from step 3 above)
- Collection price data & Collection attribute data for all collections
