The backfill-program-tx-signature script simply fetches all the transaction signatures 
from the solana blockchain for a given program address. The RPC specifies that max 1000
signatures can be fetched in a single call. This is at the core of the mechanism to determine
a stopping condition.

The script will fetch transaction signatures in a loop until it reaches the stopping condition.
Each signature will write to the file specified in the environment variables (see source code for details).
